Project Idea - Weather Notifier

User Story 1: I am a user who feels temperature alone does not capture the weather. I would like factors such as humidity to be included in the report I receive so I can get a more accurate picture of what it feels like outside.

Non functional requirement: The weather report generated will go beyond temperature and include wind speed, humidity, and UV index.

Functional requirement: There will be a threshold for the wind speed, humidity, and UV index which determines whether they will make an impact on the weather and therefore be included in the weather report. For example, users will only be notified of the UV index if it is above 7.

Functional requirement: The weather report will include the temperature. Wind speed, humidity, and UV index will appear below the weather (if they pass the threshold) along with if they make the temperature feel hotter or colder. For example: The humidity today is 90%, which may make outside feel hotter than the temperature indicates.



User story 2: I am a user who uses the weather app to prepare for my commute to and from work. I would like my weather report to show only today’s weather so I know what the weather will be like when I’m commuting.

Non functional requirement: Users shall be able to choose to only receive information about today’s weather.

Functional requirement: There will be a toggle that allows users to switch between a daily and weekly mode.

Functional requirement: The daily mode will show the current weather as well as hourly forecasts and the weekly mode will show the current weather as well as forecasts for each day.
